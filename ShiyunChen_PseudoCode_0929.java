//pseudo code of Project 1

//set the size as 500x500 or something... looks like a rectangular
//set the color background wine red
//set three lines appearing from the bottom of the canvas
//then fly to the upper screen and disapper
//set a loop for the action above, make it can continuously running
//make a pattern at the right bottom corner, still undeclared, maybe it's like a giant flower,
//or mysterious circles around circles (not only circles) in a self loop
//create the same thing in the left corner
//only thought of this so far...
